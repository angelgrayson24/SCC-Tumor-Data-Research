# SCC-Tumor-Data-Research
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.
# Drug Regimen Distribution:
The bar graph illustrates that Capomulin is the most frequently administered drug regimen, with 230 mice, while Zoniferol has the fewest users at 182. Removing duplicates, the dataset comprises a total of 248 mice. Moreover, the gender distribution reveals 124 female mice and 125 male mice.

# Regression Analysis:
Utilizing regression analysis, the relationship between average tumor volume (dependent variable) and mouse weight (independent variable) was explored. The R-squared value of 0.70 indicates that 70% of the variability in tumor volume can be explained by changes in mouse weight. This model fits the data reasonably well, making it a reliable predictor. Higher R-squared values signify a closer fit between observed and predicted data points, reflecting the model's accuracy in explaining the variation around the mean.
